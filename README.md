# About this project

Hello and welcome to my first React project ever!
This is a very simple book search engine, made with React only.

### Why this project?

I made this project as a test for a company who was looking for a junior React developer.

### How does it work?

When given an input through the search bar, the app makes a `fetch` request to a Google endpoint and it returns and renders a list of books.

### Features

The app is responsive and single-paged. 
You can choose how many books are showed per page (5, 10, 15 or 20), and there is a provided paginator to navigate through the list. 
The list is updated every time the input is changed. 
The user can click on the books to get more information, and a link to a shop is provided to buy it.
